      <description>Geegle Summit 2020! It was a web challenge where I needed to be root to get the flag. From the homepage of the website, it is understood that I need to upload a QR code and the website would scan it. Meanwhile, &amp;ldquo;ENTER GUEST AND HOST NAMES&amp;rdquo; didnt lead to any where. When I checked round, I figured out robots.txt contains a link /test/qrgen which leds to a page creating QR code by giving input.</description>

      <description>whoami Welcome to my personal space~
My name is Penny and I am studying Computer Science at University of New South Wales. I am also CTF Head of The Security Society of UNSW. My main interest is security so this blog is created for personal writings about security related stuff (and probably memes too).
My fried brain after working on security projects can be relaxed with Origami (Japanese paper folding art) which is also my big hobby.</description>
